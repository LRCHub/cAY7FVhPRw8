You put on the videohelmet
And ymu quickly realize that this is not just another videogame
Your entire field of vision fills with another worldly scene
You're in the game!
One day will come you enter the cyberspace
And you never ever want to get out
Cause reality is shit and cyberspace is gone:

Delete Yourself - Delete Yourself
GO!

Are you ready?
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!

The shit the shit is gonna make me sick
You're telling me this I tell you that
You're sitting there fat and what do you get?
Is nothing for your money!
No chance to win that's what I tell you
But find it out your problem isn't mine
Try to feel something any longer
Ha! We're getting stronger!
The end of the new age that's what it is!
Let's take the piss there's nothing to risk
Oh come on! Shoot the fuckers and sweat the technique
Two blind eyes that's what we need
Go away and play your game!
HERE'S THE ORDER:
Delete Yourself!
GO!

Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!

FBI and CIA
I'm waiting for the day when they stop playing
1984 is a joke when you see where we are 10 YEARS LATER!
War will be a warm up and then it will be forgotten
Politicians lie while others die - I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Tell the truth that's what I want
Tell a lie I can't decide whether it's right or wrong
Fuck the system, man, fuck it up!
START THE RIOT! START IT NOW!
YOU DON'T KNOW? WE TELL YOU HOW!
Come policeman shoot me down! You'll lose ATR is around!

Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win!
Delete Yourself! You got no chance to win
