Hate to see your heart break
That's what all my friends
would say
I've got nothing left to lose
'Cause I already lost you
Everyone was someone else before
Feelings flood the room
like the wine we'd pour
I was yours before
you called me mine
But,
that now feels like another life
It seems as though time has
made things worse
I know I said it healed woes,
but that was time ago
Caldercruix called and said she
Don't want the same things
No, she don't want,
the same things
Ooh
Ooh
Hate to see your heart break
That's what all her friends
would say
Nothing to be sorry for,
if I'm not what it is
that you want
Moving out of town,
wanna figure yourself out
Need some time alone,
don't want to make my house
your home
Oh, you say
you have to lose me, to find you
And I hope you do
And I hope you do
It seems as though time has
made things worse
And all the moving parts take
place on your terms
Caldercruix called and said
No, we don't want,
the same things
No, we don't want,
the same things
We got to stitch us
back together
if we can, one thread at a time
You know I don't regret it,
when I said
I had forever in mind
We got to stitch us
back together,
if we can, one thread at a time
You know I don't regret it,
when I said
I had forever in mind
We got to stitch us
back together,
back together
Now or never, yeah
We got to stitch us
back together,
back together
Now or never, yeah
We got to stitch us
back together,
back together
Now or never, yeah
Back together, back together
Because we don't want same thing
No, we don't want the same thing
We got to stitch us
back together,
back together
Now or never, yeah
Back together,
back together
Back together,
back together,
back together
